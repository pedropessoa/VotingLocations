# Voting Locations

Repository created for the final project in ECON 628. 

VotingLocations.ipynb describes the project and performs the geocoding.

PollsPlotting.R uses the coordinates that I obtain to plot the polling stations in a map.

In addition to my coordinates, I used the shapefiles in the Shapefiles folder.

The final outputs are (1) PollsGeocoded.tsv, which is a dataset containing geographical coordinates for all voting places in Rio, and (2) VotingLocations.pdf, a map of voting locations and slums within the city.
