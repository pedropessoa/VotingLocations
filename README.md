# Voting Locations

Repository created for the final project in ECON 628. 

VotingLocations.ipynb describes the project and performs the geocoding.

PollsPlotting.R uses the coordinates that I obtain to plot the polling stations in a map.

In addition to my coordinates, I used the shapefiles in the Shapefiles folder.
